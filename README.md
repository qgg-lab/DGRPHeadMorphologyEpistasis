There are two directories for the analyses:

### gwas

This directory contains the commands used to run the pipeline in dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu and the R script to generate Manhattan plot.

### networkAnalysis

This directory contains a R script that calls a igraph function to conduct the network test in the manuscript.
